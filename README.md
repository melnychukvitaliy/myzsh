# myzsh

My ZSH setup, aliases, and dotfiles.

# Projects configurations

As far a there are some personal and coroporative projects that I am working on, they all stored in one file called `projects.zsh`.

# Secrets management

To avoid any sensative information under Git it's stored in the `secrets.zsh`
